# Module 4 Lesson 2 Lab 2: Data ingestion

## Overview

### Background

In the previous lab, Wide Word Importers’ company profile, facilities, and reference data such as Contractual instrument types were created to lay the Master data foundation for Emissions calculations and Reporting. In this lab - we will perform the Activity data ingestion for the Purchased Electricity of the two newly acquired Florida facilities. In addition, we will also ingest emission data related to the charging of the fleet of 50 Fabrikam Electric trucks. The built-in connectors in the Microsoft Sustainability Manager will be used to ingest the Activity data into the application.

### Learning Objectives

In this lab, you will do the following:

-   Use Microsoft Sustainability Manager connectors to ingest data
-   Use Power Query to transform the data before ingestion
-   Review the ingested data in the “Purchase Electricity Activity Data” Dataverse Table
-   The newly ingested activity data during this lab exercise will be utilized in the remaining scenarios (calculations and reporting) in the upcoming lab exercises.

### Prerequisites

-   Microsoft Sustainability manager environment is set up with sample data
-   Lab 01 organization and reference data is entered.

### Solution Focus Area

In this lab, the focus is on the “Data Ingestion” aspect of the Solution Focus Area. It follows the “Organization and Reference data Set up” and forms the basis for the emission calculations and the reporting thereafter. The Microsoft Sustainability Manager is flexible with multiple automated options to ingest data – such as the connectors as well as manual inputs. For scenarios that may require complex data transformation and/or ETL, tools like Azure Data Factory are recommended. You can explore this functionality in deeper detail on Microsoft Docs at **Overview of Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability Data Import**, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/sustainability/import-data.

### Personas and Scenarios

In this lab, Reed Flores – IT Admin for Wide World Importers utilizes the activity data Excel spreadsheets sourced by Alex Serra – Emissions Analyst. The Activity data spreadsheets contain Electricity Purchased for the year 2022 and Miles driven by the fleet of Fabrikam Electric Trucks for the calendar year 2022. Reed observes that associated information such as product, model and Vehicle size needs to be added as custom dimension meta data before importing which are required to run the emission calculation and gather the Emission insights reports for monitoring. After adding this information, Reed uses Microsoft Sustainability Manger’s connector functionality to import from the Excel spreadsheets, and reviews other connectors available for future purposes. Reed uses the built-in Power Query functionality to transform the data to match Microsoft Sustainability Manager’s data schema and looks for other potential issues such as case-sensitive d data fields.

In this lab exercise, we will focus on the Lab 02 scenario illustrated below. 

**Note:** Make sure that you note the newly ingested activity data during this exercise because it will be used in the remaining scenarios (calculations and reporting) in the upcoming exercises.

## Exercise 1: Import Data

In this exercise, you will learn about the steps that Reed takes to ingest the spreadsheets given by Alex. Data import is a vital task to bringing large volumes of data into Microsoft Sustainability Manager. Excel is utilized in this lab; however, many pre-built connectors are available, and Partners can build custom connectors to integrate with additional data sources. You can explore this functionality in deeper detail on Microsoft Docs, please visit **Overview of data connectors** at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/sustainability/import-data-connectors.

**Important** Please ensure you have completed the previous lab to create Reference Data. **The data import process requires all Reference Data to exist, and the process is case sensitive, so please ensure the Reference data that was added has the exact same case formatting as what is found in the lab**. Failure to do so will result in errors during the data import process

1. Log into the virtual machine using the virtual machine credentials located on the **Resources** tab above.

1. Open a new browser window and navigate to https://make.powerapps.com.

        option is beneficial if the connector will be used in a scenario where the data will change frequently, such as a web API or FTP server.

      2. Turn on the **Replace previously imported data** toggle to remove all previously imported data and bring in the full dataset that was retrieved. 
         Selecting this option is beneficial if the data source isn't providing data from only the last import or if it always includes a full set of data. For 
         this scenario of importing historical data, leave both options turned off.
    
17. Select **Next** when finished.
